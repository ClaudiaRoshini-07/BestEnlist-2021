1)Create three variables (a,b,c) to same value of any integer & do the following
a) Divide a by 10
b) Multiply b by 50
c) Add c value by 60

>>> a = b = c =100
>>> print("value of  a=",a,"Value of b=",b,"Value of c=",c)
value of  a= 100 Value of b= 100 Value of c= 100

>>> print("Divide a by 10=",a/10)
Divide a by 10= 10.0

>>> print("Multiply b by 50=",b*50)
Multiply b by 50= 5000

>>> print("Add c by 50=",c+60)
Add c by 50= 160

2)Create a String variable of 5 characters and replace the 3rd character with G

>>> Str_var="abcdj"
>>> print(Str_var)
abcdj
>>> print("After replacing G",Str_var.replace("c","G"))
After replacing G abGdj


3)Create two values (a,b) of int,float data type & convert the vise versa, Hint : convert a from int to float datatype & b from float to int datatype

>>>a=2
>>> b=20.5
>>> print("a=",a,"b=",b)
a= 2 b= 20.5
>>> print("After changing a to float",float(a))
After changing a to float 2.0
>>> print("After changing b to int",int(b))
After changing b to int 20
